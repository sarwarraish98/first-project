    <p class="one"><strong>Productivity compounds</strong>Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day,
        but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or
        mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without
        thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas</p>
    <p class="two"><strong>Knowledge compounds.</strong> Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a
        commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read
        not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old
        ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound
        interest.</p>
    <p class="three"><strong>Relationships compound.</strong> People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help
        others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can
        result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.</p>
